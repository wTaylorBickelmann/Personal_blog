## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/wTaylorBickelmann/Personal_blog/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

This is a test commit. I have selected the `Merlot` theme. Hopefully this format can be used to publish jupyter notebooks and R markdown. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
